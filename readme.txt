Yegg Runner

The title screen contains three options: you can start the game, view your high scores (should be unique to each
browser/user) and you can also exit the game. 

When the game starts you control Yegg (Yellow egg) with wasd, and can jump with the space bar. objective is survive
or travel as far as possible without dying, and obtaining a new high score. 

There are two types of spike enemies, the blue ones jump and the red ones just move left faster. duck under the blue ones and jump over the red ones. single and double spikes also spawn on the ground which the player will need to 
jump over. 

There are three types of power ups (sort of) the brown dollar one gives you 50 score, the down arrows shrink you down
for 10 seconds, and finally the red skull "power down" unleashes an endless wave of spike enemies, certainly leading 
to the players demise, so avoid that one at all costs.

The player can pause with the E key and select "resume" or exit to title screen. When the player comes into contact
with a spike or enemy the game is over and can either be restarted or you can return to the main menu.
